## Hi there 👋

I'm Yun Qu 🎓, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University 🏛️.

My research primarily focuses on the exciting intersection of **Reinforcement Learning (RL) 🤖** and **Large Language Models (LLMs) 🗣️**! I'm passionate about exploring novel techniques ✨ and applications 💡 in these rapidly evolving fields.

I've had the pleasure of presenting my work at several top-tier conferences, including ICML 🏆, NeurIPS 🌟, and AAAI 🎉.

You can find more details about my research and publications on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l9Ky9goAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) 📄.

I'm always open to discussing research ideas 🤔 and potential collaborations 🤝. Feel free to connect! 😊
